> yeah,it's a girl.


Hello, I am CaoFan, a not very clever girl, a front white & a student, I hope this personal blog will urge me to learn much about front and life.

In the future, I will enter society, with excitement, tension, and some uneasy, hope I have been doing a free, hardworking girl all the time.

I practiced in a company from Shanghai, that experience let me learn much whether it is life or learning, altought there are sad and pressure, but the best effort all. I hpoe in the near future that I can find my true attribution!
